The thread-local variables mechanism stores a value of an attribute for each thread that uses one of these variables. 
You can read the value using the get() method and change the value using the set() method. 
The first time you access the value of a thread-local variable, if it has no value for the thread object that it is calling, 
the thread-local variable will call the initialValue() method to assign a value for that thread and return the initial value.
