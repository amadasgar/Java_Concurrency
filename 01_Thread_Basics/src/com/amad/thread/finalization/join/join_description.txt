join() methods in thread class makes the calling thread to wait until the execution of thread is finished on which join method is called.

Java provides two additional forms of the join() method:

	1.	join (long milliseconds)
	2.	join (long milliseconds, long nanos)

In the first version of the join() method, instead of indefinitely waiting for the finalization of the thread called, 
the calling thread waits for the milliseconds specified as the parameter of the method. For example, if the object thread1 has thread2.
join(1000), thread1 suspends its execution until one of these two conditions are met:

	1.	thread2 has finished its execution
	2.	1,000 milliseconds have passed

When one of these two conditions is true, the join() method returns.
