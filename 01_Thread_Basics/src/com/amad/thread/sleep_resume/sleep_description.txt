This program writes a Date object per second and also the message indicating that the clock thread has been interrupted.

Upon calling Sleep method the thread leaves the CPU and stops its execution for a period of time. 
During this time, it's not consuming CPU time, so the CPU could be executing other tasks.

When the thread is sleeping and is interrupted, the method throws an InterruptedException exception immediately and doesn't wait 
until the sleeping time is finished.

********************************************************************************************************************************
yield() another static method in thread class makes a thread object leave the CPU. 
It's the yield() method, which indicates to the JVM that the thread object can leave the CPU for other tasks. 
The JVM does not guarantee that it will comply with this request. 
Normally, it's only used for debugging purposes.
